Welcome to WRAP's documentation!
===================================

WRAP is an improved reconstruction algorithm for magnetic electron tomography data.

The key features of WRAP are:

* Wavelet regularisation
* Compatibility with *any* combination of input tilt angles
* Directly reconstructs A rather than B, ensuring no data is wasted
* Results in significantly improved reconstruction quality, particularly for the :math:`B_z` component

In this documentation, you will find minimal examples for how to get WRAP setup, and how to use it in a simple example.

To find out more about WRAP, please read our (upcoming) paper.
